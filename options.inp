###             Input and output grids.            ###
# All are cropped to lcmFN

#                         ** Grid description **                                                          **FileName variable**
# Input grids are: ["O" - Optional; "I" - Recommended for Initial run (Stage 1); "S" - Recommended for Subsequent run (Stage 2)]
# 1a [ IS]. Outflow directions. Integers specifying 1 of the 8 neighboring cells following the esri convention.                ->   outfFN
# 1b [O S]. CCAR (Cummulative Catchment Area). Optional, as can be calculated from outfFN. Integer number of upstream cells.   ->   ccarFN
# 2a [ IS]. LCM for "BASE" scenario. Used for (i) runoff values, (ii) FARL, (iii) cropping grids. Integer.                     ->   lcmFN
# 2b [O S]. Summed Runoff (over all upstream cells). Overrules calculation from LCM. Integer, summed percentages.              ->   roffSumFN
# 2c [O S]. LCM for GREEN scenario. Used for GREEN runoff values, and FARL (unless lakesScnFN is specified)                    ->   lcmScnFN
# 3a [O S]. FARL, imported for BASE scenario. Overrules that calculated using lakeFN. Float, range 0 - 1.                      ->   farlFN
# 3b [O S]. Grid specifying new lakes only using positive value for GREEN scenario. useLcmScnForFarlScn = F.                   ->   lakesScnFN


#Output grids are as follows. Those exported on subsequent (GREEN scenario) runs are for diagnostic purposes only.
# 1  [OI ]. CCAR (BASE), [in units of number of grid cells]         ->   ccarOutFN
# 2a [OI ]. Summed Runoff (BASE) [in units of summed percentage]    ->   outRoffSumFN
# 2b [O S]. Summed Runoff (GREEN) [in units of summed percentage]   ->   outRoffScnSumFN
# 3a [OI ]. FARL (BASE) [-]                                         ->   farlOutFN
# 3b [O S]. FARL (GREEN) [-]                                        ->   farlScnOutFN
# 4a [OIS]. flow (BASE) [m3/s]                                      ->   flowBASEFN 
# 4b [O S]. flow (GREEN) [m3/s]                                     ->   flowScnFN
# 4c [O S]. flow ratio GREEN/BASE [fraction, q_scn/qBASE - 1]       ->   flowRatioFN

## Runoff options: 
iRain    = 3.54       # Rain intensity [mm/hr].
Cr       = 1.3        # Routing coefficient. A multiplication factor on peak flow - some parts of a catchment route faster to downstream than others.
runoffFN = runoff.csv # A csv with headings "wrdclass,cv,description". cv is runoff fraction of land class specified in wrdclass in percentage (0-100).


## FARL options :
calcBaseFARL = T      # If FALSE then don't calculate BASE FARL - use a grid of ones (i.e no FARL effect) instead.
lakeId       = 8      # Integer, or R-style list of (e.g. c(8,9)), specifying that a cell is "water". WATER IS ASSUMED TO BE LAKE/POND ETC., NOT RIVER OR CANAL.
farlOpt      = FARL   # FARL calculation method. FARL2-SL & FARL2-GL can also be specified - use with farlPower ~ 1 (should give a better representation of small ponds, FARL2-GL is the most general).
farlPower    = 3.445  # Peak flows in each grid cell are scaled by FARL^farlPower.


## Grids:
#compulsory grids:

outfFN    = input/LIDAR_outf1.tif  # Flow directions (downstream), esri format: 1,2,4,8,16,32,64,128 clockwise from East.
removeEdgeCats = T  #This removes all cells downstream from the edge of either the outflow grid or cells with no outflow direction.
lcmFN     = input/LC_28039.tif     # BASE land cover.

# OUTF & CCAR grids:

ccarOutFN = output1/CCAR.tif       # Export path for CCAR, for repeat runs over the same study area.


# Runoff grids:
# BASE
roffSumFN       =                  # Load precomputed roffSum (sum of runoff over catchments), else calculate from LCM and runoffFN.

# Scenario

# FARL grids. BASE FARL uses water in BASE LCM (lcmFN):
# BASE

# Scenario

farlScnOutFN         =             # Export FARL for lakes Scenario.


## Export flow grids:
flowBaseFN      = output1/flow_BASE_scenario.tif   # Export path for BASE Scenario flow.

# Optional outlets of interest:
outletsInFN  = input/rea_checkpoints_example.csv           # csv with X and Y co-ordinates of outlets and possibly info.
outletsOutFN = output1/rea_checkpoints_example_OUTPUT.csv  # Path to output csv of flows at the outlets specified in the file pointed to by outletsInFN.
