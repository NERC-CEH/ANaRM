###             Input and output grids.            ###
# All are cropped to lcmFN

# Input grids are: ["O" - Optional; "I" - Recommended for Initial run (Stage 1); "S" - Recommended for Subsequent run (Stage 2)]
# 1a [ IS]. Outflow directions. Integers specifying 1 of the 8 neighboring cells following the esri convention.                ->   outfFN
# 1b [O S]. CCAR (Cummulative Catchment Area). Optional, as can be calculated from outfFN. Integer number of upstream cells.   ->   ccarFN
# 2a [ IS]. LCM for "BASE" scenario. Used for (i) runoff values, (ii) FARL, (iii) cropping grids. Integer.                     ->   lcmFN
# 2b [O S]. Summed Runoff (over all upstream cells). Overrules calculation from LCM. Integer, summed percentages.              ->   roffSumFN
# 2c [O S]. LCM for GREEN scenario. Used for GREEN runoff values, and FARL (unless lakesScnFN is specified)                    ->   lcmScnFN
# 3a [O S]. FARL, imported for BASE scenario. Overrules that calculated using lakeFN. Float, range 0 - 1.                      ->   farlFN
# 3b [O S]. Grid specifying new lakes only using positive value for GREEN scenario. useLcmScnForFarlScn = F.                   ->   lakesScnFN


#Output grids are as follows. Those exported on subsequent (GREEN scenario) runs are for diagnostic purposes only.
# 1  [OI ]. CCAR (BASE), [in units of number of grid cells]         ->   ccarOutFN
# 2a [OI ]. Summed Runoff (BASE) [in units of summed percentage]    ->   outRoffSumFN
# 2b [O S]. Summed Runoff (GREEN) [in units of summed percentage]   ->   outRoffScnSumFN
# 3a [OI ]. FARL (BASE) [-]                                         ->   farlOutFN
# 3b [O S]. FARL (GREEN) [-]                                        ->   farlScnOutFN
# 4a [OIS]. flow (BASE) [m3/s]                                      ->   flowBASEFN 
# 4b [O S]. flow (GREEN) [m3/s]                                     ->   flowScnFN
# 4c [O S]. flow ratio GREEN/BASE [fraction, q_scn/qBASE - 1]       ->   flowRatioFN

## Runoff options: 
iRain    = 3.54       # Rain intensity [mm/hr].
Cr       = 1.3        # Routing coefficient. A multiplication factor on peak flow - some parts of a catchment route faster to downstream than others.

## FARL options :

## Grids:
#compulsory grids:

# BASE
